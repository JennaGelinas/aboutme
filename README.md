Hello hello, I'm sorry about the bad quality photo but it was one of the happiest days of my life and I had to crop others out of it, including a Tuscan Raider. Anyways, I'm a big nerd, and I'm cosplaying as a vault dweller from Fallout in my photo. I love video games and cosplaying characters from video games. My favourite video games is Persona 3 and last year I dyed my hair blue to look like a character from the game and will probably do that again at some point.
Oh yeah, I was also here last year but only for a few weeks due to mental illness related issues, but I'm back! I will probably remain silent though because I don't talk much.
